This demo is intended to be a simple starting point for beginners interested
in writing their own OpenGL applications using the SDL framework.

It demonstrates voxel traversal of a ray through an uniform grid:

The algorithm can be used for accelerating ray tracing for example.

Usage:
moving mouse while holding left mouse button down = rotate view
moving mouse while holding right mouse button down = change ray direction
mouse wheel = zoom in or out
